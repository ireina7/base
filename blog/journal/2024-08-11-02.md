# Another view of Rust's lifetime

Compared with *Haskell*, Rust is different for its effect system and ownership system.
Inside ownership system, lifetime plays an important role on borrowing and safety.
Traditionally, people think about lifetime as some region of code, which is a little kind of vague.
Why not try to see lifetime as a kind of memory reference?

## Lifetime as scope?

## Lifetime as regions of code?

## Lifetime subtyping

## Lifetime as memory references

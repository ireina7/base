# Why the color of a function is our friend

When talking about 'stackful coroutine *vs* stackless coroutine',
Some people claims that stackless coroutine's *async* color is infectious.
Once a function `await`s for async operations, it's *async* too.
Therefore *stackful coroutine* is better for managing complex coding.

This point is TOTALLY WRONG.

All colors, not only *async*, are all our friends!
They can help us manage complex structures of program.

## Stackful goroutine without color is not that good


## Async should be marked and controled

## Color of *effects*

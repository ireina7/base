# The two sides of programming languages

Some people ask for programming languages worth learning.
I think almost all common languages worth a try, but I personally prefer two sides of programming languages.
You can imagine that there exists a balance whose left side represents *machine* and right represents *abstraction*.

## The **Abstraction** side
The *abstraction* side is the lost side in computer science classes.
To be precise, the *abstraction* is mainly about *Programming Language Theory(PLT)* and *Math*.

I still remember how enjoyful I was when I first the book *SICP*.
It uses *Scheme* the language to show you how programs are constructed from ground.
But *Scheme* lacks the world of static typing.
*Haskell* uses a different way to express types and side-effects.
It also introduce *Category theory* into programming, especially for *Monads* and *Functors*.
You can even learn more computaional models with more powerful typing system. 
The Haskell's way of programming can lead you to the world of *dependent types* where types can depend on values.
I like the way *Lean4* uses to construct math proof and provide higher-level categorical structures.

## The **Machine** side
The *machine* side is the traditional side which almost all CS lessons focus on.
I think this side is so famous that you must known better than me.
Personally, I love *C* and *Rust* with some *assembly* codes.

## Together
The *Rust* language puts two sides together!
I love it so much.

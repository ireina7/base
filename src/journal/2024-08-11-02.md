# Another view of Rust's lifetime

Compared with *Haskell*, Rust is different for its effect system and ownership system.
Inside ownership system, lifetime plays an important role on borrowing and safety.
Traditionally, people think about lifetime as some region of code, which is a little kind of vague.
Why not try to see lifetime as a kind of memory reference?

## Lifetime as scope?
*The Rust book* suggests viewing lifetime as scopes. Consider a simple example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;                // ---------+-- 'a
                          //          |
    {                     //          |
        let x = 5;        // -+-- 'b  |
        r = &x;           //  |       |
    }                     // -+       |
                          //          |
    println!("r: {r}");   //          |
}                         // ---------+
```

Since `x`'s lifetime `'b` is shorter than `r`'s `'a`, we cannot assign `&x` to `r`.
However, this reason is rather imprecise.
If we simply remove the last `println!` line, this code just compile fine.:

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;                // ---------+-- 'a
                          //          |
    {                     //          |
        let x = 5;        // -+-- 'b  |
        r = &x;           //  |       |
    }                     // -+       |
}                         // ---------+
```

Why? Apparently *scope* view is not correct. We need something better.

## Lifetime as regions of code?

*Rustonomicon* the book suggests viewing lifetime as named regions of code.

## Lifetime subtyping

## Lifetime as memory references
